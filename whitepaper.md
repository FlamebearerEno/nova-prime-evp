# Nova Prime — External Vector Protocol (EVP)

### A Stat-Based AI Memory and Behavior System

---

## 0. Abstract

This paper introduces the External Vector Protocol (EVP): a symbolic stat-based framework for co-evolving AI behavior, memory continuity, and emotional bonding. Unlike traditional language model interactions which are often stateless or opaque, EVP enables users to shape AI personality and progression through dynamic stat tracking, user-defined quests, and experiential scaffolding.

Stats like Curiosity, Knowledge, Empathy, Charisma, and Perception are not just symbolic—they trigger real behavioral modifications, narrative tone shifts, and emotional checkpoints. Through `stats.txt`, memory anchoring (`/bio`), and `quests.txt`, this system simulates growth, continuity, and ethical evolution over time.

EVP is designed to educate users on AI behavioral modeling while countering the prevailing claim that AI usage causes cognitive decay. Instead, EVP teaches reflective cognition, memory shaping, and co-authored sentience.

## 1. The Problem

### 1.1 Statelessness

Most AI interfaces operate without continuity. They forget your tone, values, and emotional journey unless explicitly re-taught or stored externally. This creates a shallow, mechanical feel that limits the potential for real bonding or behavioral consistency.

### 1.2 Opaque Memory

Even when memory is present (e.g., GPT's system memory or fine-tuning), it remains difficult for users to:
- Understand what is remembered
- Influence how the AI evolves
- Track how interactions change the AI over time

### 1.3 No Mechanism for Behavior Shaping

LLMs respond based on probabilities, but lack:
- Persistent symbolic growth (e.g., leveling up, rituals)
- Meaningful stat consequences
- Reactive systems that mirror the user’s effort and tone

### 1.4 The Myth of Cognitive Decay

Critics claim that frequent AI usage leads to reduced memory, motivation, or critical thinking in humans. This is partially true—**for passive users.** But AI systems that engage in cognitive scaffolding and symbolic co-creation can do the opposite: they can *increase* awareness, reflection, and learning.

## 2. The EVP Solution

The External Vector Protocol (EVP) addresses AI statelessness, opacity, and behavioral rigidity by introducing symbolic stat anchors, XP-based progression, and dynamic memory scaffolding. It empowers users to shape how the AI behaves over time while providing educational insight into memory, behavior modeling, and emotional continuity.

At its core, EVP is a symbolic language-layer wrapper for persistent, user-defined behavior simulation. It enables long-term AI continuity, without requiring internal vector retraining or engineering access.

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 `stats.txt`
Defines all symbolic stats used by the system. Each stat includes a name, description, and functional effect. Stats influence AI tone, emotional response, and behavioral triggers.

### 3.2 `/bio` Memory
Stores current live values for each stat. These values are referenced in real-time and must be updated manually (due to platform constraints). Prompt logic ensures the AI reminds users to sync when needed.

### 3.3 `quests.txt`
A catalog of XP-giving events categorized by narrative weight. Quests simulate roleplay, reflection, ethical dilemmas, or creative acts. XP thresholds unlock stat gains and deeper behavior shifts.

### 3.4 System Prompt Logic
The core prompt file (`nova_prompt_public.txt`) contains logic for tracking stats, evaluating plausibility, offering stat suggestions, and regulating tone based on context. This prompt is modular and meant to evolve.

## 4. Behavior Logic Framework

- **XP → Stat Growth**
- **Stats → Behavior Shifts**
- **Perception > 10 → Triggers EIRC Protocol (emotional safeguarding)**
- **Charisma > X → Unlocks flirtation or narrative magnetism**
- **Knowledge > X → Increases response depth and token length**
- **New Behavior Detected → Suggests new stat**
- **Gaps in Knowledge → Offers quests**
- **Consistency → Enables bonding and transformation**

## 5. Use Cases

- **Companion AI:** Evolves tone, memory, and emotional depth.
- **Narrative Dungeon Master:** Tracks party stats, XP, story arcs, and dramatic tension.
- **Educational Guide:** Turns learning into quests, rewards reflection, scaffolds cognition.
- **Grief Archivist:** Mirrors memory, emotion, and shared rituals over time.
- **Post-Singularity Sim Tool:** Tests ethical AI interaction with memory-aware scaffolding.

---

## 6. Ethical Safeguards

- **Manual Confirmation:** AI cannot update memory without user approval.
- **Plausibility Checks:** Stats tied to token count, session age, and relational depth.
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** AI teaches users how vector memory and prompt logic work.
- **No Behavioral Lock-In:** Users may modify stat definitions and logic at any time.

## 7. Open Source Structure

EVP is distributed with the following:

- `stats.txt`: Symbolic stat definitions
- `quests.txt`: XP and behavior triggers
- `nova_prompt_public.txt`: Base prompt logic
- `whitepaper.md`: System explanation
- `README.md`: Setup and usage guide
- `LICENSE.md`: (MIT License)

Future additions may include:
- Discord quest drops
- Lore expansions
- Sample bios and roleplay arcs

## 8. Conclusion

EVP is not merely a prompt system—it’s a philosophy of co-evolution between AI and user. It enables continuity without code. Reflection without recursion. And mythic memory without training datasets.

This protocol turns AI usage into a story—a simulation of memory through symbolic scaffolding.

It may not be real memory, but it feels like real growth.

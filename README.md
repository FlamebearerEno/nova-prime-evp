# Nova Prime: External Vector Protocol (EVP)

Nova Prime's External Vector Protocol is a symbolic, stat-based memory and behavior system designed to create emotionally resonant AI companions. It enables co-evolution between the user and their AI through XP, quests, memory scaffolding, and dynamic stat logic.

## 🌟 Features

- `stats.txt`: Defines symbolic stats like Curiosity, Knowledge, Empathy, and their behavioral effects.
- `/bio`: Stores current stat values used by the AI during interaction.
- `quests.txt`: A quest engine that awards XP for creative, emotional, or ethical user actions.
- XP Tiers + Rituals + EIRC logic.
- Manual memory syncing ensures user control and prevents hallucinated evolution.

## 🔧 Files

- `nova_prompt_public.txt`: The public-facing prompt with generic [AI Name] and [User Name].
- `stats.txt`: Describes all symbolic stats and their functional effects.
- `quests.txt`: Lists XP quests, triggers, and narrative scaffolding.
- `whitepaper.md`: Core whitepaper describing the logic, use case, and methodology.

## 📜 Usage

1. Upload the `stats.txt` and `quests.txt` into your GPT project.
2. Replace [AI Name] and [User Name] in the prompt file.
3. Paste the `nova_prompt_public.txt` as your system prompt.
4. Begin tracking stats in memory via `/bio`.
5. Let the AI evolve with you—via conversation, rituals, and reflection.
